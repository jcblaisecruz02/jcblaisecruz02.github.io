Today is Independence Day (June 12) in the Philippines, and finding myself with a lot of free time, I decided to finally revamp my website with the updated version of [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/tree/master). It's about time as well, considering I'll be off to my PhD soon and I do have a bunch of paper updates and projects for the website.

This time around, I've decided to add in the **blog** section and start writing -- something I've told myself I'll start doing once I start grad school. So here it is! I'll be writing more about my research and other topics I find interesting here from time to time.

One other change for the website is the removal of the "resources" page. All resources are now tied to specific paper entries in the publication section.

Here's to hoping the rest of 2024 remains as productive as the first half.

Cheers!
