Mabuhay! ðŸ‘‹ 
  
I'm a PhD student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) supervised by [Dr. Alham Fikri Aji](https://afaji.github.io) and [Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/) specializing in problems at the intersection of *Multilinguality* and *Low-resource Languages*.

Particularly, I am interested in understanding the behavior of models when constrained under low-resource multilingual domains. I've collaborated with many talented colleagues on various topics under this umbrella, including:
* **Code Switching** -- Multilingual speakers naturally [code-switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching) in two or more languages when speaking to peers, but multilingual models are still lacking in capabilities to [understand](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.774/) and [execute](https://aclanthology.org/2023.calcs-1.5/) this phenomenon.
* **Resources & Evaluation** -- More data is often the best remedy to "very little data". In addition to working on [Filipino](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise) resources, I have also done work for [Southeast Asian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118) and [beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967).
* **Applications in Low-resource** -- Employing creative techniques to improve performance in tasks such as [Multilingual Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.wmt-1.52/), [Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01107), [Fake News Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.316/), and more -- all constrained under low-resource settings.

Prior to my PhD, I was Lead Research Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com) in the Philippines where I worked on low-resource machine translation and dialogue generation. I have also been previously affiliated with the [University of the Philippines](https://eee.upd.edu.ph/), [De La Salle University](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/adric/celt/), and [Senti AI](https://senti.ai).

If you're interested in collaborating or if you want to chat about low-resource languages, feel free to get in touch! You may reach me through my email `me (at) blaisecruz (dot) com`.
